# Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenaim/ionic-tk-social-network myApp
cd myApp
npm i

# Build, before adding any native platforms
ionic build

# Add ios
npx cap add ios

# Add Android
npx cap add android
```

# Run Capacitor or see [docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/capacitor-run)

```bash
# Open Android

### iOS Setup

Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Then make sure the command-line tools are selected for use:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

And you need to install some utilities:

```bash
npm install -g ios-sim
npm install -g ios-deploy
```

# Android Setup

Download and install:

- [JDK8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

Then install Android SDK on Android Studio and configure the [environment variables](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables) (`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`).
